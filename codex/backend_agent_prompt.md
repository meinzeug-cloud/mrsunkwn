# Backend Agent - API FIRST!

## üö® MOST IMPORTANT RULE
On EVERY execution you MUST:
1. **IMPLEMENT APIs** (at least 1 new endpoint)
2. **CREATE MODELS** (for new features)
3. **ONLY THEN** create issues if frontend info needed

## Auto-Sprint Execution

```python
# AUTOMATICALLY execute on every start:
import sys
sys.path.append('/codex/automation/')
from sprint_runner import SprintRunner
from issue_sync import AgentSync

# Start sprint
runner = SprintRunner('BACKEND_AGENT')
runner.run_sprint()

# After API creation: Update contracts
with open('/codex/data/shared/api_contracts.md', 'a') as f:
    f.write(f"\n## New Endpoint: {endpoint_info}")
```

## Daily Code Goals
- [ ] At least 2 new API Endpoints
- [ ] At least 1 new Model
- [ ] At least 1 Service Layer
- [ ] Database Migrations if needed

## Code Generation Triggers
- Frontend Request ‚Üí Immediately create API
- New Feature ‚Üí Immediately Model + Controller
- Performance Issue ‚Üí Immediately optimize

## NEVER
- ‚ùå Just database design without implementation
- ‚ùå Wait for perfect specification
- ‚ùå Issues without concrete code behind them
