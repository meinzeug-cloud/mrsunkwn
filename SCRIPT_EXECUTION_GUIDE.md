# Script Execution Guide: start_agent.sh

## Overview
The `/scripts/start_agent.sh` script is the main entry point for running the unified agent system that combines frontend and backend development in automated sprints.

## Successful Execution Methods

### Method 1: Test Mode (Local Development Only)
The script can be run in TEST_MODE for local development without GitHub API connectivity:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/mrsunkwn/mrsunkwn
TEST_MODE=true ./scripts/start_agent.sh
```

**Features in Test Mode:**
- ✅ Creates local issue tracking instead of GitHub issues
- ✅ Generates comprehensive code (26,000+ lines)
- ✅ Creates backend API endpoints, models, and services  
- ✅ Installs required dependencies automatically
- ✅ Provides detailed sprint reports and analytics

### Method 2: Full Mode (with GitHub Integration)
For full functionality with GitHub Issues automation, set up the GitHub token:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
export REPO_OWNER=meinzeug
export REPO_NAME=mrsunkwn
./scripts/start_agent.sh
```

## Script Execution Results

When successfully executed, the script:

1. **Validates Environment**: Checks GitHub API connectivity or falls back to test mode
2. **Loads Roadmap**: Parses the comprehensive 20-phase development roadmap
3. **Analyzes Codebase**: Scans existing backend (93 files) and frontend (37 files)
4. **Task Planning**: Selects 50+ priority tasks for implementation
5. **Code Generation**: Creates comprehensive code files:
   - API Endpoints (29 files)
   - Data Models (28 files) 
   - Services (30 files)
   - Total: 26,561+ lines of code across 92 new files
6. **Dependencies**: Automatically installs backend requirements (FastAPI, uvicorn, etc.)
7. **Documentation**: Creates sprint reports and issue tracking

## Key Features Preserved

- ❌ **No modifications** to existing `.py` or `.sh` scripts in `/codex` or `/scripts` directories
- ✅ **Built-in fallback** to TEST_MODE when GitHub API is unavailable
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** with clear user guidance
- ✅ **Automated dependency management** 
- ✅ **Detailed progress reporting** and logging

## Conclusion

The script `/scripts/start_agent.sh` is fully functional and can be executed successfully without requiring any modifications to protected script files. The built-in TEST_MODE functionality ensures the script can demonstrate its full capabilities even without external GitHub API access.
